# Advent 2018
Solutions to Advent of Code 2018, in Scala

## What is this?

These are my solutions to some of the Advent of Code 2018 problems, written in the Scala programming language.
The aim is to have type-safe, correct, thoroughly tested solutions that work with any input. Brewity and raw speed are secondary concerns. 

## Usage

- Each day is a separate [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) project with its own directory.
- Type `sbt run` to run the solution, or `sbt test` to run the corresponding test suite.

## Contributing

These are *my* solutions. Please don't contribute your own solutions here.
